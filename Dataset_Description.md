## Dataset

The dataset I will be using is PokeAPI v2. I am planning to create a Pokédex containing data on the original 151 Pokémon.
The data I am going to use involves Pokemon, Types, Abilities, and Pokemon Species. Pokemon, Types, Abilities, and Pokemon Species are all tables under the Pokemon database. The data from the API is in JSON format.
